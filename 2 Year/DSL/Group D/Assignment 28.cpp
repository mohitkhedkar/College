// Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. 
// If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. 
// Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.
